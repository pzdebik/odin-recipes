The project summarizes basic HTML and Git skills, that I've learned at The Odin Project site:
	- Creating HTML boilerplate
	- Using HTML elements for listing, adding images, anchoring, providing emphasis on text
	- Process of maintaning Git Version Control (staging, commiting and pushing files)
	- Using CLI commands
